                    The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire 
                    youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach, 
                    team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from 
                    this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey 
                    background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

                                IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12 and older.

                            <p>
                                Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.

                                    U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.

                    All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play atleast fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are encouraged to play their players 50% of each game.
